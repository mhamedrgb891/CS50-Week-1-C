# Week 1 – C Programming Foundations 

 Part of **CS50x 2024 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University**

##  Overview
This week introduced the basics of C programming. Topics included variables, data types, conditions, loops, and the structure of a simple C program.

##  Topics Covered
- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Basic input/output using `printf` and `scanf`

##  Projects
- ✅ Mario (less)
- ✅ Mario (more)
- ✅ Cash
- ✅ Credit

##  Key Takeaways
- Gained experience in writing, compiling, and debugging C programs.
- Learned how to use loops and conditions to solve practical problems.
- Understood how to work with user input and modularize code with functions.

##  Challenges
The hardest part was implementing the Luhn algorithm in the Credit project. It required careful tracking of digit positions and summation logic, but it greatly improved my attention to detail and understanding of algorithms.

## ▶ How to Run
```bash
gcc file.c -o output
./output
